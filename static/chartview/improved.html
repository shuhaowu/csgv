<h3 class="text-center">School Improvements from 2010 to 2012</h3>
<p>This page summarizes the improvement of Colorado's schools. Different parameters such
as the average growth rating over 3 years and the grade and rank difference between
2010 and 2012 contributes to a final score found in the last column of the table below
(the "Index" column). A lower "index" value means that the school has improved more over
2010 to 2012. Index values ranges from 1.1 to about 4.2.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: The following analysis is not a comprehensive mathematical
assessment and should not be viewed as such. The interpretation below
only aims to approximate the growth of each respective school using
an arbitrary scale. </p>
<h4>Interpretation</h4>
<p>It is important to note the available data is limited, and as a result no
definitive conclusion can be reached as to why these schools are improving.</p>
<p>The index value provided should be used as nothing more than a guide as it does not have
any meaning on its own and only provide a scale to compare each schools (lower the better).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is easy to see that schools with low index values have improved a great deal
according to the numbers provided by the Colorado department of education. However, there
seems to be no correlation with the district or the enrollment numbers, as one could see
from the table below.</p>
