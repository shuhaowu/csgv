<h3 class="text-center">Wealth vs Grades</h3>
<p>Since higher a percentage of students enrolled into the free/subsidised lunch program <em>probably</em>
implies that these students come from poorer families, the free/subsidised
lunch program data is used to attempt to correlate the grade of a school with
the wealthiness of its students.</p>

<p>The graph below is a scatter plot of school grades plotted against the
percentage of the students in the free/subsidised lunch program.</p>

<h4>Interpretation</h4>
<p>As one could see from the chart below, there seems to be a correlation between the two variables.
Calculating the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient">Pearson correlation coefficient</a>
yields <code>-0.58</code>, <code>-0.60</code>, and <code>-0.59</code> for 2010,
2011, and 2012 respectively, which indicates a medium to strong correlation.
However, one must note that the school grade data is used here is
heavily bin'ed. Futhurmore, the school grades are based off of a relative scale, which may skew the chart below. That said,
the data available should be able to give an impression on what the general trend is when it comes
to wealth vs grades.</p>
