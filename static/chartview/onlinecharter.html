<h3 class="text-center">Online Charter Analysis</h3>
<p>This page is the analysis of the grades of online schools, charter schools,
traditional schools, </p>
<p>The first chart is the mean ranks for different categories from 2010
to 2012. For example, if the mean rank for a category is 100 out of a
possible of 1000, it will be the 90th percentile as 90% of the schools are
below that rank.</p>

<p>The second chart is a collection of histograms of school ranks of the four
different type (online, charter, both, neither) from 2010 to 2012.</p>
<p>All statistics can be found in tables below the graphs.</p>

<h4>Interpretation</h4>
<p>In general, charter schools do not experience a significant increase in
student performance compared to their traditional counterparts.
Online schools tend to perform worse than both traditional and charter schools,
 with their results falling significantly behind other types of schools in all
 grade levels. However, as there are a very limited number of online schools,
 one must be careful
with the conclusions drawn from this data due to the small sample size.</p>
