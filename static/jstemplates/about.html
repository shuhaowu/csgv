        <h4 class="text-center">Thoughts on Analysis <br /><small>My 2&#xa2; on the data and its analysis</small></h4>
        <p>After two weeks of fiddling with the Colorado grades data,
        I have identified lots of limitation in the data provided and summarized
        it in the follow few points: the data is
        heavily bin'ed, the grades data are relative to each other, and
        the data is incomplete and does not go back in time long enough.</p>

        <p>The first problem is a serious roadblock for in depth analysis. While
        this is done for a good cause (you obviously don't want to release
        student data onto the internet), it draws the line
        between what <em>could</em> be possible and what <em>is</em> possible.
        Furthermore, the data is also bin'ed into letter grades from F, D-, D, to A+.
        This is illustrated in the <a href="#charts/frl">wealth vs grades</a> analysis
        as it is evident that all the data points follow a horizontal line.</p>

        <p>The second issue has some implications on the interpretations of
        <strong>any</strong> analysis done with the data. Relative data means that
        there is no way to tell if two schools with scores of 66% and 67% (these are just
        examples, not actual data) are actually 1% apart or 20% apart. Relative data
        hides the distribution of the original data. Hence, one must be careful when making
        any inferences from it. That said, relative data <strong>do</strong> give you
        an idea of what the underlying distribution of the scores is and the analysis
        done on the scores cannot be completely ignored but can only be treated as "hints".</p>

        <p>The last point was an obstacle for coding this project. A lot of time
        were spent dealing with the incompleteness of the data (such as missing ranks from 2011).
        This, however, can be justified as the data provided are not meant for machines but rather
        humans to interpret, even though it would be nice if CSG provded
        processed data as oppose to the raw CSV data. The missing/redacted entries in the rows of the CSV sheet
        made it difficult to take every school into analysis performed. Furthermore,
        The lack of historical data makes it difficult to extract trends to help predict the
        future.</p>

        <p>In any case, it would be preferable to see data that's not bin'ed (not necessarily
        individual data, but continous grades instead of the discrete ones), not relative,
        and spans a longer period of time.
        Raw data will be preferable as more statistical tools can be used and a lot of people
        much smarter than myself will participate in attempting find trend in the data.
        However, the data provided is already fairly impressive compared to many other
        education departments and some hints can be drawn from the results of the analysis done
        of them.</p>
