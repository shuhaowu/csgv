        <h5 class="text-center">Explorer View</h5>
        <p>The explorer view offers a geographical way for views to find schools
        and get information from them. There are five views associated with the
        explorer view: <em>enrollment default view</em>, <em>enrollment heatmap</em>, <em>rank default view</em>,
        <em>rank heatmap</em>, and <em>most improved heatmap</em>. </p>
        <p>The default views (enrollment and grade defaults) shows only a handful of schools when zoomed out.
        However, when you zoom in, the system will find schools that are less
        significant and put them on the screen. For example, in the enrollment
        default view, at default zoomlevel you only see the biggest schools in
        terms of population. As you zoom in, smaller schools starts appearing.</p>
        <p><span class="label label-info">Note</span> Red markers are for high schools and blue are for elementary/middle schools. Try clicking on them to see more information.</p>
        <p>You can also search for schools using their names from the search bar at the top right of the screen.</p>
        <dl class="dl-horizontal">
          <dt>Enrollment default</dt>
          <dd>Shows all the school with markers. Smaller schools requires zooming in.</dd>
          <dt>Enrollment heatmap</dt>
          <dd><span class="label label-warning"><abbr title="Depending on your computer, this may or may not be slow. Try zooming with the scroll bar at the left of the screen.">May be slow</abbr></span> Shows all the
          school in the form of a heat map. This is view is best at showing where
          student populations are concentrated.</dd>
          <dt>Rank default</dt>
          <dd><span class="label label-warning"><abbr title="Due to technical limitations with google maps, this will be a slow view. Various optimizations have been done to ease the symptome on newer computers. Try zooming with the scroll bar at the left of the screen">Slow</abbr></span>
          This view uses a circular marker to show schools and their ranks.
          Schools with better ranks will be bigger while schools with lower
          ranks will be smaller. Similarly to the default view, zooming in will show
          schools with lower ranks.</dd>

          <dd><span class="label label-warning"><abbr title="Depending on your computer, this may or may not be slow. Try zooming with the scroll bar at the left of the screen.">May be slow</abbr></span>
          Shows the ranks with a heatmap. While what this map shows is speculative, one can see
          from this view that the ranks are not completely dependent on population.
          </dd>
          <dt>Improved heatmap</dt>
          <dd>This view shows where the top 200 schools in term of being most improved from 2010 to 2012 are concentrated.</dd>
        </dl>
        <hr />
        <h5 class="text-center">Tabular View</h5>
        <p>The tabular view offers to segregate the data into different years
        and levels in a table format. This table can be sorted by columns, allowing
        users to find connections between data.</p>
        <p><span class="label label-info">Note</span> Clicking on the names of each school
        will bring up the same details dialog as the explorer view details dialog.</p>
